# An Example Python Program
Suppose you had some work to do. Suppose you thought "I know, I'll automate this
by writing a Python application!" and now you're using it every single day. We
(your co-workers) would really appreciate it if you took a few steps to make
your program easier to use and maintain. This repository will teach you how.

**Start by using the github 'commits' view to view this project as far back in
the past as you can.** Then you can follow through the changes as they were
added. The readme file is updated in each commit to describe the changes to so
that you can see how we go from a single monotlithic application with no tests
that is hard to maintain, to a simpler application with reusable components that
is easy (or at least easier) to maintain.

Our example program adds is very simple so that we can focus on the changes we
should make, but they same ideas work just as well on large programs. Lets start
by writing a program that adds two numbers that are passed as command line
arguments and then we'll move on.
